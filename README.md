<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src="/ss.png">

Naviquest is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with the Leaflet library and display Map. This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as Webpack to bundle the modules, and Babel to convert ES6, ES7 and ES8 back to ES5. The user can add workouts for running and cycling and these are stored via local storage.

###   Details

1.  It defines two classes, Workout and its child classes Running and Cycling, to represent workout sessions.

2.  Workout has properties such as date, id, clicks, coords, distance, and duration.

3.  Running and Cycling classes inherit the properties and methods of Workout, and they also have their unique properties such as cadence for Running and elevationGain for Cycling.

4.  The code defines an App class to handle the entire application's functionality, including getting user's location, loading a map, handling user input, and saving and retrieving data from local storage.

5.  It uses the Leaflet library to render a map and allows users to click on the map to add a new workout session.

6.  The code validates user inputs before creating a new workout session and checks if they are all positive numbers.

### Built With

This app is built with pure vanilla JavaScript along with HTML and SCSS. It uses webpack as module bundler and NPM as package manager.
